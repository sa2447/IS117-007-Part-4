                <p class="text-left">&emsp;&emsp; The Cult of the Dead as the name implies worships death. They are a group of various living people or high ranking undead such as liches and vampires.
                    They have hordes of undead at their beck and call and their higher ranking members travel with hundreds of zombies and the like. While they were more active they were using plague and disease to
                    terroize villages and add to their undead horde. Luckily for the those who live on the continent the group of heroes from Silverkeep stopped several of the high ranking members of the cult. This 
                    stopped the bulk of the cult but the cult's mysterious leader is still at large and was never caught.

                <h5><b><u>Cult of the Abyss</u></b></h3>
                <p class="text-left">&emsp;&emsp; The Cult of the Abyss worshiped the various demon princes from the infinite abyss and tried to find a way to allow the denezins of the abyss to walk to prime material plane.
                    They attempted this by creating an unholy life that would constantly build upon is stored power and eventually blow a hole right to the Abyss. The vessel for this ended up being the party's fallen ally Otto.
                    Being controlled by Demogorgon , Otto did many henious acts in order to try and bring about the doom of the mortal plane. The party traveled to the Abyss inorder to stop Otto's mind control at the source.
                    Luckily they were successfull and the cult has been silent ever since.

                <p class="text-left">&emsp;&emsp; The Cult of the Emperor is the oldest of the cults on the continent but also the most secretive. Following the former head of the Royals <em>"Emperor"</em>, the cult has done very little openly.
                As the most secretive of the cults very little is known, the party only learned of their existance thanks to the members of Leontari who came from the same plane of existance as the Royals. The party has also only
                run into one true member of the Cult but there is for sure many more hiding in the shadows.</p>
