        <h2>The Counsel of Giants</h2>
        <p class="text-left">The Counsel of Giants is made up of six main Ancient Giants as well as the giantkin and others under them. The Main Six of the counsel are originally from the same plane of existance as the 
            Royals. They are the direct children on the Royal known as <em>"King"</em>, as such they have extraordinary power that rivals if not surpasses many of the gods. Each one of the six is also the embodyment of
            a certain aspect, the aspects being "Might", "Elements", "Forge", "Hunt", "Speed", "Trickery". While the Counsel of Giants has not made any direct apperances as of yet, their chose group of heroes has. These 5 heroes of the Giants
            have clashed with the main party several times and in the end they worked together to finally end the conflict between the Giants and Dragons

                        Surprisingly he was blessed by the Giant of Speed despite technically being a dragonkin. Seven-Ti is actually a desserter of the Dragon faction as he no longer belived in their methods. Choosing
                        to use his fists over traditional methods many enemies do not expect much of him, but his fists themselves are stronger than most weapons enchanted or otherwise. He has also earned himself a minor
                        divinity allowing him to turn into the embodiement of speed, while his physical form does not change his muscles and internals are rewired and strengthened allowing him to move faster than before.

                        a minor divinity allowing him and Claw to combine. Together they form a hybrid with the top half of a giant and the bottom half of a Behir. Despite his large size in this form he is able to turn invisable and move 
                        just as stealthy as before, his attacks are stronger and he becomes better in close combat making up for one of his greatest weakness.
