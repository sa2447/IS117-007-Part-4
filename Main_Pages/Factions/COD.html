        <h2>The Counsel of Dragons</h2>
        <p class="text-left">The Counsel of Dragons is made up of six main Ancient Dragons as well as the dragonkin and others under them. The Main Six of the counsel are originally from the same plane of existance as the 
            Royals. They are the direct children on the Royal known as <em>"Queen"</em>, as such they have extraordinary power that rivals if not surpasses many of the gods. Each one of the six is also the embodyment of
            a certain aspect, the aspects being "Power", "Magic", "Fire", "Alchemy", "Creativity", "Decay". These dragons have chosen the main party to be their heroes and to help them end the conflict between them.

                    <p class="text-left">Artix is the oldest of Ancient dragons and is the aspect of Power. He is a very strict and by the book dragon believing it is his duty and his duty alone to protect his siblings.
                        In combat he is the strongest dragon, despite having no intrest in magic his raw power and Fire breath are more than enough. He often butts heads with Raynet as Raynet takes things to casually. While 
                        he did not choose any of the main party to bless he did bless Dave as Dave and Artix's son had become friends.

                    <p class="text-left">Raynet is the second oldest of Ancient dragons and is the aspect of Magic. He is the exact opposite of his brother Artix, he is more easy going and finds rules boring. When it comes 
                        to magic Raynet is unmatched which more than makes up for his lack of normal combat skills. As the former conduit of magic in the dimension the Royals are from Raynet is not bound by the rules and 
                        restrictions that exist here and abuses his magic for petty things like making clones so he can avoid meetings. Despite his carefree attitude Raynet is the only one of the Ancient Dragons to beat Artix in
                        a fight. He choose to bless Thrice of the main party.

                        combat.
