                &emsp;&emsp;The party first met in a tavern in Bekensdale near Giant country, the members being a human named Otto and his gun named Izeah, a tiefling named Shalith, a goblin named Klink, a Golith named Thrice, and a gnome named Tifatina. 
                As the party left the tavern, the town was being overrun by a small troupe of giants and their kin. After “saving” a town guard named Dave the party left the town.
                While fleeing from the main entrance the party was stopped by a silver dragon. While the Dragon’s brood dealt with the Giant’s forces inside the town the dragon introduced himself as Raynet. 
                Raynet had asked the party to go into no-man’s land and retrieve a certain core from the ruins of a colossal warforged. After accepting the mission Raynet was pulled away by a very annoyed looking gold Dragon.
                <br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;The party leaving the town of Bekensdale, headed directly to No-Man's land, on the way discovering quite the odd sight of pancakes. 
                After two of the party members ate the pancakes a cackling could be heard through the woods but nothing noticeable happened yet. 
                As their journey continued, they spent their last night in the woods just outside no-man's land where the source of the cackling revealed itself. 
                A creature calling himself the Jester appeared before the party to thank them for freeing him and disappeared promptly after.
                <br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Once in No-Man’s land the party found the ruins of the colossal warforged and proceeded to climb it in search of the core. 
                After clearing a swarm of Modrons the party found warforged belonging to the order of the sword, a group of warforged left in the No-Man’s land after the great war. 
                After defeating some and convincing the others to let them pass they found the core. 
                The core however was guarded by a mechanical golden ram, which the party eventually defeated, taking both the core and the remains of the ram. The party’s troubles were not yet over as the Lord of blades, leader of the Order of Blades, was in the ruins as well looking for the core. 
                Before they could be found the Jester once again appeared to the party and offered them a deal, if they agreed to free his superior he would hide them save them from their impending doom. 
                Reluctantly the party agreed.
                <br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Once out of the Colossal warforged the party was contacted by Raynet who informed them of a nearby area where they would be able to get transportation to him. 
                With that the party was off on their way to the ruins of G.I.G..On the way the party came across another unusual sight: a salad in the forest. 
                Remembering their deal with the Jester they freed whatever was inside.  
                Before making it to GIG they found out what they freed a being known who called herself “The Queen” once thanking them she disappeared. 
                The party continued on the way and eventually made it to the ruins of GIG. Once inside they came across a strange little Mechanical Goblin named “G0bL1n”. 
                While speaking to G0bL1n the building was under siege by a giant scouting party, G0bL1n however quickly took care of the attackers. 
                Continuing their conversation G0bL1n’s creator Rell and a golden goblin named Aseir, who was a former head of GIG, returned to the building. 
                While conversing the rest of the Giant party arrived to finish destroying the remains of GIG. 
                Aseir asked the party to head down to the basement and destroy the malfunctioning guard unit. 
                Traveling to the basement the party confronted the guard and although they successfully defeated it they lost Otto and Izeah in the process. 
                With the mess upstairs cleaned up Asier teleported the party to the abandoned town where Raynet waited for them.
                <br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;In the town the party spoke to Raynet telling him of both the Jester and the Queen. 
                Concerned about what they released on the world, Raynet decided to tell them what he knew of the two beings. 
                After his tale Raynet told them about what he had them gathered and gave them a town and some starter funds.
                While talking to Raynet a figure approached from the shadows a Leonin who after some talking joined the party. 
                Soon after the gold dragon from earlier also appeared, and introduced himself as Artix. 
                With these two dragons present they granted the party another gift, the Dragon Mark granting the party a plethora of benefits. 
                After the dragons departed the Jester and Queen once again appeared before the party, this time with a warning for them. 
                Telling them that under no circumstance should they free the King or an even greater threat may befall the world and with that warning they once again left very quickly. 
                The party now has a town to build, and Raynet had given them the idea to recruit people for the town from the survivors of Bekensdale. 
                <br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;After planning their route to not only go to Bekensdale but also the camp housing Bakar's people and Klink's hometown of Aberdeen the party was off. 
                First was the closest Bakar's people, once arriving at the camp they noticed it under siege by followers of the Lord of Blades. 
                Jumping to the rescue the party made quick work of the attacking warforged capturing one that had suspiciously surrendered. 
                Quickly fleeing the scene with their prisoner in tow. Once bringing Bakar's to people to Sliverkeep the party left for Bekensdale. 
                On their return to Bekensdale and meeting the captain of the guard Cedric and convincing him to move his people to Silverkeep. 
                While at Bekensdale they also met 3 shop keeps who happened to be friends of Dave Rangrim the dwarf blacksmith, Jillian the halfling alchemist, Rolen the elf fletcher, besides Dave's friends they also found his wife.
                Before they could leave however they were attacked by a squad of giants led by a chain wielding giant. 
                The party did manage to repel the attack and sent the people of Bekensdale to Silverkeep. 
                Next the party went to Klink's home of Aberdeen where they met Klink's mom Ilaxi Dobu and the eldritch being Jerry. 
                Despite the presence of an eldritch being the biggest problem was the presence of a barghest in disguise as the village chief. 
                After a tough battle with the barghest and his hobgoblin minions the party came out on top  and with the goblins recruited they sent them off to Sliverkeep. 
                On their own way back to the their town the party came across a knight in bone armor riding a nightmare leading an army of undead. 
                After a tough battle they managed they managed to repel the knight whose name they learned was Tanner and turned their attention the the army. 
                While they did defeat the army they suffered a loss as Dave was disintegrated, however thanks to the mysterious coin from the Jester Dave was brought back to life.
                 Once they finally returned to Silverkeep Bakar went and interrogated the warforged who finally revealed their name which is just his serial number 2179843. 
                 Now free 2179843 works with Klink's mom on Klink's garden.
                <br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;With the town populated and all the buildings built the party now needed to secure trading rights with the mortal kingdom, which is required a meeting with the king of Falconreach. 
                With the help of Aseir they managed to secure an audience with him. 
                After two weeks the time finally arrived for the party to leave for the capital through a portal provided by Asier. 
                Once in the capital the party took a lightning rail straight to the kings castle. 
                Once their they were met with the sight of not only the king of Falconreach Issac, but an oblesik containing the The final part of the strange trinty of  Jester, Queen, and now King (for clarity the the king of falconreach will be referred to as Issac).  
                Issac asked the party to clear out an infestation of undead within his walls. 
                The party headed out and made quick work of almost half the undead before noticing something was up, the undead were bleeding an awful lot and instead of fighting back started running. Once the party realized these weren't undead but in fact innocent civilians. 
                Outraged the party traveled back to Issac's throne room to confront him, Issac however was unfazed by the parties outrage and after some quick discussion allowed them to leave and granted them trading rights. 
                The party demoralized while heading back to Silverdale was attacked by assassins which seemed to have a grudge with Shalith. 
                After repelling the assassins the party finally decided to rest after quite the stressful day.
