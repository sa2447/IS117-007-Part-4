        &emsp; &emsp;Before the war the mortal kingdoms lived in relative peace and ruled the continent. 
        For reasons lost to time The Mortal Kingdoms split and started a large scale Civil War that lasted nearly 150 years. 
        The war while contained to the continent still shook the very world. 
        To gain an upper-hand over their counterparts the warring kingdoms turned to their wizards to find a way to mass produce magical items. 
        Those dedicated to this study became the first Artificers and their creations led to the war being even bloodier than before. 
        <br>
        &emsp; &emsp;In order to combat the growing number of causalities the Artificers started creating sentient golems known as the Warforged. 
        The Warforged were made for combat and placed on the front lines and were a deadly force on the battle field for both sides, but they were only a shadow of what was to come next. 
        100 years into the war a new and even more deadly weapon was brought onto the field of war, The colossal warforged, a Gargantuan creation meant to end the war.
        The land were these Constructs fought and now rest was damaged beyond repair and the magic that seeped into the land mutated the landscape creating what is now known as the Wastelands.
        The Wastelands are where the remains of a dozen of these colossal warforged rest and the other warforged who didn't get the memo the war is over still clash to this day.
        <br> 
        &emsp;&emsp;Once the colossal warforged were unleashed on the battle field the war only lasted another 50 years before coming to a sudden end due to the awakening of older powers the Giants and Dragons. 
        When the Giants and Dragons came back to the land they both took over 1/4 of the continent each leaving the mortal kingdoms and The Wastelands in between separating the two. 
        With a considerable less amount of land to occupy and their numbers already dwindled from the war the Mortal Kingdoms reformed against their will but unable to do much else. 
        With their return the Giants and Dragons brought with them their ancient war against each other. To the relief of the Mortal Kingdoms most of the conflicts between the two factions occur in the Wastelands, however it is not uncommon for a village or small town to be destroyed in a skirmish. 
        With the new age of relative peace the Mortal Kingdoms and the artificers with not much else to do started making magic items for the common folk to make their lives easier such as airships and lightning trains for transportation, magical banks with an interconnected network, and magical items to make life simpler. 
        While the mortal kingdoms stay neutral to the war between the Giants and Dragons there are still many who for the right price are willing to serve as mercenaries. 
        Those mortals favored by either the Dragons or Giants are granted special boons and pillages from the respective side. 
        Its also not uncommon for mortal villages and small towns close to either Dragon or Giant land to pledge allegiance to the corresponding faction in hopes for protection.
