            their main captiol of Falconreach. While there are still many outposts and smaller villages and towns in the surrounding area, many decided to move back to the capital after the arrival of the Giants and Dragons.
            A marvel of Artifice and magic the main city is a steampunk paradise where its people prosper and survive even with the troubling state of the continent.
